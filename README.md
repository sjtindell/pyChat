# pyChat
Python. CLI chat server/client handling multiple connections.

ToDo:
- store and display user names
- do not overwrite typing with broadcast
- inform when user left
- differentiate between server broadcast, user broadcast
  so that when a user enters, it doesn't display [user] blank entered room
- add usage, command line control
